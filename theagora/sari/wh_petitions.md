| ☒ [P1](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/call-permit-generic-drug-remdesivir-urgent-medical-care-early-infected-2019-ncov-sari-asia) | theagora  |   a  | Call for Permit of Generic Drug of Remdesivir for Urgent Medical Care to the Early Infected of 2019-nCoV SARI in Asia | As per 2019-nCoV epidemic has been spreading fast with a worldwide momentum but no evidence tells it will stop in the month-counted future. We strongly suggest the federal government to coordinate the ongoing process of clinical trial on the early infected but NOT ONLY the heavily-injured patients, AND permit the test of generic drug for the Remdesivir. Here are the reasons: 1) Huge number of early infected are NOT counted in the reporting system, and they will SOON become seriously infected due to lack of proper treatment. 2) It could be a convincing model for a for-profit organization to cooperate with sovereigns for long-time strategies but NOT ONLY take defensive actions against patent squatting in PHEIC incidents. |
| ☒ [P2](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/urge-china-government-disclose-adequate-information-and-offer-fair-medication-infected-patients-covid-19) | leixiling, stevenhoosh |   a  | Urge China Government to Disclose Adequate Information and Offer Fair Medication to the Infected Patients of Covid-19 | The global outbreak of the Covid-19 (a.k.a. SARI or SARS-CoV-2) has been developing rapidly within communities. And the delayedly-announced PHEIC will last for several months according to research model and updated data, much longer than the propagated. In order to gather sufficient decision making support, we the world require the transparency of information from the source to - including but not limited to - 1) Release medication information of Kriging and/or Remdesivir in terms of symptomatic groups, dosages, and designated hospitals; 2) Employ comparable analysis to amend the statistics data of deaths; and 3) Explain the disproportionately small number of testing cases before 2/2/2020, in contrast to the suppliers' data and the tests after that day. |
| P3 |zlf19820410|   d  | 开放克力芝和瑞德西韦两款专利的仿制药授权给中国，要求美企协助、监督中国临床及用药 | 1.请求美国开放克力芝和瑞德西韦两款专利的仿制药授权给中国，直到大规模疫情结束，或提供廉价的这两款药物帮助中国控制疫情，以避免全球陷入危机。2.请美国公司如吉利德等在协助中国进行临床试验以及提供药物的过程中，监督药物使用的公平性，特别请美国援华专家团队监督在武汉，湖北等疫情危重灾区的共平施药问题，尤其是针对大量轻症患者的施药问题。3.召集全球华人感谢吉利德等药物研发企业对此次防疫的巨大贡献，向全球华人宣传吉利德公司对中国防治乙肝、艾滋、丙肝等恶性传染病做出的突出成就，并设立基金，募资酬谢吉利德的研发投入。 |
