| P1 | theagora  |   a  | Urgent Medical Care to the Early Infected of 2019-nCoV SARI in Asia: Calling for Permit of Generic Drug of Remdesivir | As per 2019-nCoV epidemic has been spreading fast with a worldwide momentum but no evidence tells it will stop in the month-counted future. We strongly suggest the federal government to coordinate the ongoing process of clinical trial on the early infected but NOT ONLY the heavily-injured patients, AND permit the test of generic drug for the Remdesivir. Here are the reasons: 1) Huge number of early infected are NOT counted in the current reporting system book, and they will SOON become heavy infected due to lack of proper treatment; 2) It could be a model manner of a for-profit organization's defensive action against patent squatting in PHEIC incidents. |
| P2 | leixiling |   a  | 敦促中国政府处理2019-nCoV疫情用药透明、公平、公正 | 希望在武汉的新药（克立芝或remdesivir）的施行信息能透明，公布施用状况、对症人群、定点医院等信息，保障用药的公正、公平 |
| P3 | leixiling |   d  |  | 呼吁政府对武汉还建房的小区采取规范的管理措施，目前武汉大量的还建小区物业在前期对疫情不重视，管理松懈。导致最近出现大量的感染者，并且疫情还在逐渐加重。同时，对于出现疫情的小区，由于闭市，得不到物资供应，人群只能集中去更远的超市购买物资，这导致在超市购物的人群和员工互相交叉感染，疫情进一步蔓延，目前已有消息证实上述所说的正在成为现实。 |
